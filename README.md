This is the source code of my portfolio site, [andrewberls.com](http://www.andrewberls.com). It's still very much a work in progress, but feel free to have a look around!
The site is divided into two components: the portfolio page and the blog. The blog runs on SutroCMS, a basic CMS which I'm writing from scratch in Rails. This site is the first and only site running on Sutro - I\'ll be releasing its source as a separate project when there is more in place.

### Features
* Basic multi-user system (administrator only)
* Users can create and manage blog posts by logging into a private backend


### To Do
* More multi-user support, e.g. permission levels
* Pagination of administrative and public post listings
* Dashboard view
* Tag support
* Post comments
* Tighter validation on passwords, emails, etc
