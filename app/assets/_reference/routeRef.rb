# Sample of regular route:
#   match 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
# Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

# Sample of named route:
#   match 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', :as => :purchase
# This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)

# Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
#   resources :products


# Sample resource route within a namespace:
#   namespace :admin do
#     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
#     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
#     resources :products
#   end

# See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes"
