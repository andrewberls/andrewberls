Title: Styling buttons with Sass

button -> radius -> gradient -> rad mixin


finishing touches
html -> raquo
button mixin, with color parameters



<p>On every single web project I've worked on, I find myself having to style decent-looking buttons. Instead of rewriting them from scratch every time, I have a pretty standard block of code I paste around between projects, and I figured I would share, despite it being rather simple. For fun, I'll write it using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> (something I rave about in just about everything I write) to make things a little easier.</p>

<h5>The Basics</h5>
We'll start with the HTML - all we need is a single anchor with a class.
<pre>
<span class="label"># index.html</span>
<a href="#" class="button">Full Post</a>
</pre>

<p>This doesn't look like much of anything, so let's add some style to our button class.</p>

<pre>
<span class="label"># style.scss</span>
.button {
	background-color: #3099DF;	  
	color: white;  
	font-family: Arial, Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;
	font-size: 0.8em;     
	padding: 7px;
}
</pre>

<p>That's a good start - all we're doing here is some font basics, adding a nice blue background color, and some padding to make it look more like a button.</p>
